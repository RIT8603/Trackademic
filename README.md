## ⚡ How It Works

1. Student enters the class → Camera captures video.
2. AI Face Recognition → Matches with student database → Marks attendance.
3. Data stored securely in **MySQL/MongoDB**.
4. Dashboards update in real-time → Students, teachers, admins, parents get insights.
5. AI suggests tasks/projects in free time + monitors engagement & exam activities.

## 🎯 Impact

* Saves **20–30 minutes per class** wasted on manual attendance.
* Provides **data-driven insights** to teachers and admins.
* Improves **student engagement & discipline**.
* Scales easily from **small colleges to large universities**.
