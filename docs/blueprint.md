## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and authority, referencing the 'Smart Automation in Education' theme, while avoiding cliches. 
- Background color: Light Gray-Blue (#E8EAF6), visibly desaturated relative to the primary and creating a dark scheme.
- Accent color: Purple (#7E57C2) providing contrast and drawing attention to key elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font known for its modern, neutral, and objective appearance; it will serve effectively for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, clear icons to represent attendance status, activity types, and alert categories.
- Implement a clean and intuitive layout that balances information density with ease of use, prioritizing key metrics.
- Employ subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback and guide users through the interface without being distracting.
